# AshokaComputationalPhysics

Bounce.py - Visual Python code file - This is probably the program you should do first if you're getting started with computational physics simulations. Should get you familiarised with the basic functionality of the software. ( First program ) ( Original code from the demo examples )

Earth revolving around the sun simulation - ( VPython simulation )rather simple demonstration of the law of gravitation in practice, in VPython. If you're learning VPython, this is the second program. ( Self made original code )

GalaxiesExp.py - ( Vpython code ) - Uses NumPy n-dimensional arrays for fast calculations. Relies on basic gravitational equations and gaussian distributions. Original credits for code go to @jzhu98. I've merely played around with the vectors, and tried to optimize the code.

hw(jan:2018).ipynb - ipython code for graphs of various functions (week one homework). ses NumPy n-dimensional arrays for fast calculations. 

Chargingcapacitor.html - plots the graph of charge(Q(t)) vs time(t) as discussed in prof. Phookun's class
